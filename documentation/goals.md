# City Problem #6: Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites.

# PROMPT: 
    City of San Jose doesnâ€™t have the best understanding of the ideal spots to place Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites based on the physical infrastructure around it (ie libraries, hospitals etc) and resident perception

# GOAL: 
    create an application that can help current and potential EIH users access resources and help make their process easier. 

# note: 
i think the translator and the speech bot can be placed in the same page.
it can reduce the excess space and it will look a bit more cohesive. 
it can go under as translator and speech
