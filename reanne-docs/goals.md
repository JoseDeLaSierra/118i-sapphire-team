# PROMPT: 
    Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites. City of San Jose doesnâ€™t have the best understanding of the ideal spots to place Emergency Interim Housing (EIH) sites based on the physical infrastructure around it (ie libraries, hospitals etc) and resident perception

# GOAL: 
    create an application that can help current and potential EIH users access resources and help make their process easier.
